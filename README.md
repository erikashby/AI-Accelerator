# AI-Accelerator
Welcome to my personal class pages as I work throgh the AI Accelerator by Nate B Jones.

## About This Repository
This repository is intended to be a public space where I share lessons learned and insights gleaned while taking this class.  The intent is to provide a resource for others (either students or professionals) who may be on a simular AI journey.

## About the Class
I personally follow Nate on social media, and Substack and have come to appreciate his insights into AI.  As part of this I found that he offers a small (8-15) people class each quarter on the fundementals of AI.  Although I have been working in AI as a produt manager since 2017, I felt it would be a great opportunity to take a step back and learn from someone like Nate.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
